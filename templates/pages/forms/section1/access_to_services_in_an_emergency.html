                    In the event of an emergency, recipients will request assistance from a 24-hour staff member, all of whom are trained in {{agency.name}} emergency procedures and would help them evacuate the building.
                    The following events would constitute an emergency that would require the recipient to report immediately to a staff member:
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    1. Smelling or seeing smoke or fire <br>

                    3. Flooding water <br>
                    4. Apparent illness of another person or staff member <br>
                    5. Unlawful entry of a person onto the facility <br>

                    Recipient or staff may call 911 in an emergency. In the event of a fire, all staff is trained during bi-annual fire drills to meet at a predesignated area
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recipients who are experiencing an emergency in their home would access immediate services by dialing 911 and then contacting
                    their case manager for support.

                <p>
                    The above written policy has been explained to me and I understand what I need to do in the event of an emergency.
